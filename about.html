I play guitar since 1995, studied in various major and not major music schools (read my articles on Berklee, London Music School and CAVEM), but mostly self-taught. Though I had a lot of fun, I realized I would be better earning stable income elsewhere (link to my article about music business), not in music, so I kept it as a hobby. 
Anyway, I like to learn new solos by transcribing (link to transcriptions) rather than buying guitar lessons, because like this I just learn the phrase that I like (and that is usable in the solo), not some abstract exercise.
One day I got bored with guitar sound, so I changed the tuning -> this gave me new horizons for exploring.
Keep it going...
