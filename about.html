  <p>Playing the guitar after my main job, I composed music of different styles, outplayed in the different bands. I started with CAVEM Music School in Luxemburg (my teacher was the best guitar player in the world â€“ Michel Volkmann) , later I moved to the UK and did a lot of gigging in Midlands (Nottingham, Derby, Leicester) , in between I also went to guitar sessions at Berklee in 2000 and a year of guitar performance at London Music School.
<p>
Now, when I have a family, and even if it is not my main job, I still feel the passion for music.</p>
